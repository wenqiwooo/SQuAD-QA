As such , its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link , not end-to-end . Any <unk> must be carried out by higher layer protocols . The <unk> <unk> protocol is part of the <unk> protocol suite , which consists of the lower three layers of the <unk> Model . It was widely used at the <unk> for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s , to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks . Some implementations used <unk> within the network as well , but its <unk> features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient . Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the <unk> Model . However , its address field ( the Data Link Connection ID , or <unk> ) can be used at the <unk> network layer , with a minimum set of procedures . Thus , it <unk> itself of many <unk> layer 3 <unk> , but still has the <unk> as an ID beyond a <unk> layer two link protocol . The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than <unk> . Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol , like <unk> it does not define internal network routing operations . For <unk> its packet IDs -- -the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses . The same is true for Frame Relays <unk> . How this is done is up to the network provider . Frame Relay , by virtue of having no network layer procedures is <unk> at layer two , by using the <unk> Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode ( <unk> ) . <unk> connections are typically established for each communication session , but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the <unk> without the <unk> handshake . For a while , Frame Relay was used to interconnect <unk> across wide area networks . However , <unk> and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol ( IP ) at the network layer , and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) and or versions of <unk> Label Switching ( <unk> ) at layer two .
